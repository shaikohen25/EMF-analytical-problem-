# Electromagnetic Fields (EMF) Project 

This project simulates and analyzes charge distributions and capacitance properties of a disc-shaped conductor placed in an electric field, using numerical methods.


## Features
- Numerical solution for charge distribution over a disc-shaped conductor.
- Capacitance calculations for varying distances between parallel plates.
- Graphical comparison between numerical and theoretical capacitance values.

## Key Functions
1. **`is_in_circle(R, d, i, j)`**: Determines whether a grid point lies inside the disc.
2. **`generate_coordinates(R, d)`**: Generates coordinates of points within the disc.
3. **`build_interaction_matrix(points, D=0)`**: Constructs the interaction matrix for potential equations.
4. **`solve_charge_distribution(V, R, d, D=0)`**: Solves the charge distribution system.
5. **`calculate_total_charge(charge_distribution)`**: Computes the total charge.
6. **`plot_capacitance_vs_distance()`**: Plots capacitance vs distance and compares with theoretical results.

## Results
- Capacitance values for distances `D = R/2` and `D = R/5`.
- Visualization of the capacitance as a function of distance.

## Example Output
```
Capacitance for D = R/2: 1.2345e-10 F
Capacitance for D = R/5: 2.3456e-10 F
```

## Graph
- The plot illustrates both numerical and theoretical capacitance vs. distance.
